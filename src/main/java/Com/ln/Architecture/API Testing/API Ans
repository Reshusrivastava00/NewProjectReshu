1. What must be checked when performing API testing?
During the API testing process, a request is raised to the API with the known data.
This way we can analyze the validation response. While testing an API, We should consider:
* Accuracy of data
* Schema validation
* HTTP status codes
* Data type, validations, order and completeness
* Authorization checks
* Implementation of response timeout
* Error codes in case API returns, and Non-functional testing like performance and security testing

2. What are some architectural styles for creating a Web API?
This is one of the fundamental Web API interview questions. Bellows are four common Web API architectural styles:
* HTTP for client-server communication
* XML/JSON as formatting language
* Simple URI as the address for the services
* Stateless communication

3. What are the common API testing types?
  While there are certainly specialty tests, and no list can be asked to be comprehensive
 in this realm, most tests fit broadly into these following nine categories that you should
 remember before attending in an API testing interview.
 * Validation Testing
 *Functional TestingUI testing
 * Load testing
 * Runtime/ Error Detection
 * Security testing
 * Penetration testing
 * Fuzz testing

 4. What is the procedure to perform API testing?
  * Choose the suite to add the API test case
  * Choose the test development mode
  * Demand the development of test cases for the required API methods
  * Configure the control parameters of the application and then test conditions
  * Configure method validation
  * Execute the API test
  * Check test reports and filter API test cases
  * Arrange all API test cases

  5. What are major challenges faced in API testing?
  If you can overcome the challenges in API Testing, you can be confident in the API testing interview too.
  They are:

  * Parameter Selection
  * Parameter Combination
  * Call sequencing
  * Output verification and validation
  * Another important challenge is providing input values, which is very difficult as GUI is not available in this case.

  6. What kinds of bugs that API testing would often find?
  Missing or duplicate functionality
  Fails to handle error conditions gracefully
  Stress
  Reliability
  Security
  Unused flags
  Not implemented errors
  Inconsistent error handling
  Performance
  Multi-threading issues
  Improper errors

  7. Options Method : The OPTIONS Method lists down all the operations of a web service supports.
  It creates read-only requests to the server.

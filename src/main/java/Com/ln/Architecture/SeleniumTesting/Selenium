1. Find Broken Links in Selenium.
A broken link, also often called a dead link, is one that does not work i.e. does not redirect to the webpage it is meant to.
This usually occurs because the website or particular web page is down or does not exist. When someone clicks on a broken link,
an error message is displayed.

** Use the following steps to identify broken links in Selenium:
Collect all the links present on a web page based on the <a> tag
Send HTTP request for each link
Verify the HTTP response code
Determine if the link is valid or broken based on the HTTP response code
Repeat the process for all links captured with the first step

Cross Browser Testing:
 Its a type of functional test to check that your web application works as expected in different browsers.

Why do we need Cross Browser Testing?
Web-based applications are totally different from Windows applications.
A web application can be opened in any browser by the end user.
For example, some people prefer to open https://twitter.com in Firefox browser,
while otherâ€™s can be using Chrome browser or IE.

Reason Cross Browser Issues

1. Font size mismatch in different browsers.
2. JavaScript implementation can be different.
3. CSS,HTML validation difference can be there.
4. Some browser still not supporting HTML5.
5. Page alignment and div size.
6. Image orientation.
7. Browser incompatibility with OS. Etc.

How to perform Cross Browser Testing
If we are using Selenium WebDriver, we can automate test cases using Internet Explorer,
FireFox, Chrome, Safari browsers.
To execute test cases with different browsers in the same machine at the same time
we can integrate Testng framework with Selenium WebDriver.

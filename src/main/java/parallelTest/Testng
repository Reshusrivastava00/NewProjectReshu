why we send thread count in testng? :
        It's the number of tests that are run at the same time.
        It takes up more slots in the grid because is uses one grid slot per test run.

Cross Browser Testing : Cross Browser Testing is a type of functional test
to check that your web application works as expected in different browsers.

Summary :
1. Cross browser Testing is a technique to test web application with different web browsers.
2. Selenium can support different type of browsers for automation.
3. Selenium can be integrated with TestNG to perform Multi Browser Testing.
4. From parameters in testing.xml we can pass browser name, and in a test case,
   we can create WebDriver reference accordingly.

Thread count : Thread count is basically a number of instances running
               to execute multiple tests simultaneously or in parallel.
               The attribute thread-count allows the user to specify
               how many threads should be run for this execution.

Priority (priority=1) : Priority is an attribute that helps the users define the order
                         in which they want the test cases to be executed.
                         When we have multiple test cases and want them to run in a particular order,
                         we can use the Priority attribute to set test priority in TestNG

Enable/Disable(Enable=false)/(by default :Enable=true) : To disable a test in TestNG, we should
                         set the enabled attribute of the @Test annotation to false .
                         The default attribute value of enabled is true.

Grouping((groups = { "Reshu" }) : TestNG Groups allows us to perform groupings of different test methods.
                                   Grouping of test methods is required when we want to access the test methods of different classes.
                                   Not only we can declare the methods within a specified group.
                                   we can also declare another group within a specified group.

run one test multiple times : (invocationCount = 10)
